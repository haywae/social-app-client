/**
 * This file is used to provide type definitions for Vite's client-side environment variables and features.
 * By default, it includes a triple-slash directive to reference the type declarations for `vite/client`.
 * This gives you TypeScript intellisense and type-safety for properties like `import.meta.env` and `import.meta.hot`,
 * and also provides type definitions for importing common asset types (e.g., .svg, .png).
 *
 * @see https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#client-types
